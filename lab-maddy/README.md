# Documentation:
  * What this project does:
   The goal of this project is to practice using Mongo.

  * We will be able to work with the MongoDB database management system
  * We will understand the primary concepts of working with a NoSQL database management system
  * We will be able to create custom data models *(schemas)* through the use of mongoose.js
  * We will be able to use mongoose.js helper methods for interacting with their database persistence layer

# Any resources that helped me complete this assignment:

# How another dev could 'get started' with my api on their own:
      - How do you clone this project?
      First fork from my repository, then clone from your repo, then create a branch.
      - How do you start using this project?
          1. You will need to have NodeJS installed on your machine.
          2. You will need to install httpie in one terminal window.
          3. Then start up nodemon in a separate terminal window.


HOW TO TEST POST IN TERMINAL:


HOW TO TEST GET with Mongo:

```

```

HOW TO TEST A PUT IN Mongo:



HOW TO TEST DELETE IN Mongo:


# Packages and commands to remember:
  - In package.json's scripts, add- "start:debug": "DEBUG=http* nodemon server.js",
  - created an index.js and set it as the start point in package.json
  - deleted parse-url.json and ________
  - added a cors.js file

  - npm install express - DONE
  - npm install (for node modules) -
  - npm install httpie -
  - npm install superagent -
  - npm install uuid -
  - npm install -D jest -
    - npm test

  - node server.js or just nodemon (depending on the day??)
    - rs (restart, if needed)
  - run start: watch -
  - npm run start:debug - then attempt a POST and this will tell you where you're wrong

  - npm run debugger -
  - npm install bluebird (sets this as a dependency in package.json) -

  I added the following to my package.json scripts:
  "debugger": "node inspect server.js",

  I've added the server.js to the lib directory.

  Then in terminal, within the project directory, type:
  npm run debugger

    - You should then see:
    > node inspect server.js
